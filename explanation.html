    Keyboard controls:
    <ul>
        <li>Press 'h' to toggle the visbility of these explanations.</li>
        <li>Press 'p' to toggle GUI visibility.</li>
        <li>Press 'a' to toggle the animation of the body moving along the orbit. Note this is done incorrectly by uniformly changing the true anomaly instead of time. The animation is only intended to illustrate prograde vs. retrograde motion.
